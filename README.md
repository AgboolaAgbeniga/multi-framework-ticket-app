# Multi-Framework Ticket Management System

A comprehensive ticket management application implemented in three different web frameworks to demonstrate cross-framework development patterns and best practices.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project showcases the same ticket management functionality built using three popular web development stacks:

- **React + TypeScript** - Modern frontend framework with type safety
- **Vue.js + TypeScript** - Progressive framework with excellent developer experience
- **Twig + PHP** - Server-side templating with traditional MVC architecture

All implementations share the same core features, UI design, and user experience while leveraging each framework's unique strengths and conventions.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- 🔐 **User Authentication** - Login/logout with session management
- 📋 **Ticket Management** - Create, read, update, and delete tickets
- 🎯 **Status Tracking** - Open, In Progress, Closed ticket states
- ⭐ **Priority Levels** - High, Medium, Low priority classification
- 📊 **Dashboard Analytics** - Ticket statistics and overview
- 🎨 **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first UI with consistent styling

### Technical Features
- **Local Storage Persistence** - Client-side data storage (React/Vue)
- **File-based Storage** - JSON file storage (Twig/PHP)
- **SPA Routing** - Client-side navigation (React/Vue)
- **Server-side Rendering** - Traditional page loads (Twig)
- **Consistent API** - Same data models and business logic across frameworks

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### React Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State**: Local Storage + Context
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Vue Implementation
- **Frontend**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS

## 📖 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for React/Vue apps)
- PHP 8.1+ (for Twig app)
- Composer (for Twig app)

### Running the Applications

#### React App
```bash
cd react-ticket-management-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Vue App
```bash
cd vue-ticket-management-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Twig App
```bash
cd twig-ticket-management-app
composer install
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

## 🎨 Design System

All implementations share a consistent design system:
- **Color Palette**: Professional blue/gray theme
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Layout**: Responsive grid system
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library

## 🔧 Development Philosophy

This project demonstrates:
- **Framework Agnostic Design** - Core functionality works across different architectures
- **Consistent UX** - Same user experience regardless of underlying technology
- **Best Practices** - Framework-specific patterns and conventions
- **Scalability** - Clean code structure ready for expansion
- **Maintainability** - Well-documented, organized codebase

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

By comparing these implementations, developers can learn:
- Framework-specific patterns and conventions
- Trade-offs between client-side and server-side rendering
- State management strategies
- Routing approaches
- Build and deployment processes
- Code organization techniques
